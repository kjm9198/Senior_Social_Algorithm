Social Networking Platform for Seniors

Description

This Java project is a backend simulation for a social networking platform tailored for seniors. The platform features a premium package "Karuzela," enabling seniors to engage in audio-video conversations. It implements two matching algorithms: a random pairing and a token-based prioritization system.

Key Features:
Random Pairing Solution Seniors are randomly paired with each other for conversations.
Heap Sort Solution: Seniors are matched based on their token count using a heap sort algorithm, ensuring efficient and fair pairing.
Token System: Implements a token-based system where seniors use tokens to initiate conversations.
Results Output: Generates output files with details of the conversations that took place.
Getting Started

Dependencies
Java JDK 8 or higher.
Running the Application
Compile and run Main.java to execute the solutions.
The results will be written to text files in the format specified.
Algorithm and Data Structure Choice

Random Solution: 
Utilized java.util.Random for its simplicity in generating random pairings.
Heap Sort Solution: Chose a heap sort algorithm for its efficiency, particularly its O(n log n) complexity, making it suitable for the token-based prioritization system.
Results Analysis

The analysis in Main.java compares the effectiveness and profitability of both solutions for the platform and provides insights into their operational dynamics.
